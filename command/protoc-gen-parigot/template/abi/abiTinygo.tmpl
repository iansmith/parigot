// This file has been machine generated from proto/abi.proto.  DO NOT EDIT OR YOU WILL LOSE.

// This file is here to tell tinygo what functions to elide when
// it is generating code for this package.  Most IDEs get confused when
// you have "non defined" functions, although it's perfectly valid
// go.  The functions that start with _ are potentially restricted
// (dangerous).  The functions that are the real implementations
// are implemented by the container, are not in the source or address
// space of a client, and have a trailing _.  Functions with more
// complex signatures (e.g. if they use a string) have to binary
// patched into the wasm module because we are using tinygo and it
// doesn't understand that we want to control the wasm-level type
// signatures.

//
// These functions have the true function name at the WASM level.

{{- range .abi.GetWasmMethod}}
func {{.GetName}}_({{.AllInputsWithFormals false}}) {{.OutputType}}

//
// These functions are wrappers around the true ABI functions, as is done with libc.
// We have to patch functions that take arguments outside of the basic four, and this
// is done with binary editing after compilation is finished.
