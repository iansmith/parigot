// This is the File service for parigot.  It is sandboxed such that caller to this service
// has limited access to files. The caller can expect that "/app" is a directory in which new
// files can be created and existing files can be found.  
// 
// Paths must be UTF-8 encoded with no control characters, without leading -, without . or ..
// elements, and without carriage returns or newlines.
//
// This api provides no synchronous interface to reading or writing file content.  The caller will
// be handed an Id upon successfully starting a read or write.  That Id can be used later to 
// query the status of the read or write and it is expected that this will be driven by the *end user*,
// such as a user on the internet with a web browser.

  // symlinks, are readable, etc.
