// This is the File service for parigot.  It is sandboxed such that caller to this service
// has limited access to files. The caller can expect that "/app" is a directory in which new
// files can be created and existing files can be found.  Attempts to create or open files
// that have spaces in their path are ok, but not paths that include dots (.)  or other special
// characters (like % or #) which will be immediately rejected with a FILEERRORCODE_PATH_ERROR.
// Paths should only have characters that letters, numbers, and space.  The filesystem provided
// is case preserving, but not case sensitive. It is therefore recommended to use only lower case
// letters in path names.
//
// The creating of deeply nested directories within /app is not permitted.  Currently the limit for
// directory depth is 4, so a directory like /app/foo/bar/baz is ok but a directory like 
// /app/quux/fleazil/frobnitz/yack is not.
//
// This api provides no synchronous interface to reading or writing file content.  The caller will
// be handed an Id upon successfully starting a read or write.  That Id can be used later to 
// query the status of the read or write and it is expected that this will be driven by the *end user*,
// such as a user on the internet with a web browser.
