// The syscall package does not have a "service" because the calls
// made against the kernel of parigot.  If you made a kernel interface
// how would you Locate it without needing a kernel?

// This file defines some error constants for each of the
// built-in (kernel) types.  These are errors that intended to
// be compared against when receiving an error value. The first
// test of the error value is `IsError()` and if that is true
// you can use `ErrorCode()` to get a Uint16 that is the error
// code.  You can compare it to values in these enums at your
// discretion.  
//
// All of the kernel calls return KernelErr as the error code
// inside a KernelErrId.
