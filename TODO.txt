## smallish

### WASM
* Do a check of the WASM spec to make sure I have all the opcodes and instruction formats
covered in the parser, `command/Wasm.g4`
  * Need to figure out if we want to support particular version (2.0?)
  and possibly particular feature sets

### compiler (protoc-gen-parigot)
* make locator template something that can be selected from the command line
* walk through the code paths and get return values to always be parigot.Error
* flow the errors through the compiler so we can report them back to the protoc level
* enums, especially for the errors coming back from dispatch -- and that should be
coordinated with client side service
* repeated objects in a messages
* rip out all of the "Get<Blah>" methods and make them more goish.

### logging
* Need to have a debug "blob" for services that captures everything together
* service calls with parameters, log messages

### transform
* rip out all of the "Get<Blah>" methods and make them more goish.

### link-time
* investigate unlinking for languages that end up with runtimes in the wasm

### surgery
* change the way we implement replacement functions to be a replacement import
    * add the "normal" replacement, if that works correctly

### ids
* change to either 128 or 192 bit ids, packed into a struct
* add an extra byte that is reserved for future use (net of 112, 176 bits)
* if 192, add a crc

## Web Coord Language
- define css rules of interest
- laconic style html dev
- section of text functions that are connected to html dev
- css can also be attached to html dev
- events attached to html
- functions provided in assemblyscript? typescript? go?
