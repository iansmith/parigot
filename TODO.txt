## smallish

* Do a check of the WASM spec to make sure I have all the opcodes and instruction formats
covered in the parser, `command/Wasm.g4`
  * Need to figure out if we want to support particular version (2.0?)
  and possibly particular feature sets


* make each generated package have a "register" method to register everything
* make locator template something that can be selected from the command line
* make log() on client side service do somethnig sensible and possibly automatically
inject the service name into the log messages
* walk through the code paths and get return values to always be parigot.Error

* flow the errors through the compiler so we can report them back to the protoc level
* enums, especially for the errors coming back from dispatch -- and that should be
coordinated with client side service
* prevent generation of extra messages Locate<blah>Request and LocateBlahResponse

* rip out all of the "Get<Blah>" methods and make them more goish.

* investigate unlinking for languages that end up with runtimes in the wasm
