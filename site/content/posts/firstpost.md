I woke up at about 5am with an idea in my head.  The idea was to build an operating
system (of sorts) in go, but with user processes created from WASM binaries.
After some thinking, the idea started to congeal a bit and I realized I was trying to
fix something that had bugged me about microservices for some time: microservices are
good (great?) for the deployment and operational problems of devops, but it is 
radically harder to develop and debug an array of microservices once you get to about
6 or 8 services.

> Microservices, for when a function call is too straightforward.
