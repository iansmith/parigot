{{% blocks/lead color="primary" %}}

parigot provides a new programming model for building microservice applications.
parigot allows the _developer_ to see the application as a monolith... because
a monolith is much easier build, test and debug!  When the application is deployed
it can be deployed as separate microservices and these interact with each other
in a way familiar to any microservice developer.  The ability to choose a 
monolith or a microservice-based run or deployment of the program can be done
at run-time with no code changes.
