The name WASM which is pronounced "wazem" is an acronym of WebASeMbly, if a bit 
inelegantly. The name is used to refer to both a file format and a processor
specification.  

### Processor Spec

The details of the [WASM processor spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/syntax/instructions.html) is beyond the scope of this document.  In summary, it is
specification for a virtual CPU, similar to the spec produced by Intel, AMD or
other chip vendors when describing their processor offerings.  If you are 
familiar with another virtual hardware spec, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
the WASM spec is __far__ lower level than JVM spec. The WASM spec was designed to make
the job of a Just-In-Time compiler easy compared to other virtual machines. 

A "WASM file" refers to a file, usually with the extension ".wasm"
