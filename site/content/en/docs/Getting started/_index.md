### Tooling

This project makes heavy use of __dev containers__ which is a relatively new
tactic for what is an age-old problem.  A dev container is a
[container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) whose image (files,
tools, and environment) is already packaged so that development work can proceed
without needing a lot of "set up your machine" processes and time.  

With [VSCode](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=download+vscode&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) the container is actually run by the editor (really "dev
environment" or "IDE") and the editor knows how to work with the dev container
for doing things like running programs, launching the debugger, using the
shell *inside* the container.

#### The quick and mostly easy way



* What do your users need to do to start using your project? This could include downloading/installation instructions, including any prerequisites or system requirements.

* Introductory “Hello World” example, if appropriate. More complex tutorials should live in the Tutorials section.

Consider using the headings below for your getting started page. You can delete any that are not applicable to your project.

## Prerequisites

Are there any system requirements for using your project? What languages are supported (if any)? Do users need to already have any software or tools installed?

## Installation

Where can your user find your project code? How can they install it (binaries, installable package, build from source)? Are there multiple options/versions they can install and how should they choose the right one for them?

## Setup

Is there any initial setup users need to do after installation to try your project?

## Try it out!

Can your users test their installation, for example by running a command or deploying a Hello World example?
