Microservices have become the _de facto_ way that engineering teams build 
the back end of applications. They have become sufficiently popular that 
tech industry reports have stopped listing microservices as an "upcoming"
or even "current" technology.  Unknown to many is that the choice to use a
microservice-oriented design has substantial negative consequences for
the developers and first level managers who are "in the trenches" actually
_making microservices work_.

* The parigot system proper was developing entirely in [golang](https://go.dev).
* The list of people that have provided valuable feedback, if it included all those
    that have helped, would make this page unusable.  We apologize to anyone we

* During the summer of 2023, we had two folks who helped out project by contributing
    their time. Xinyu Chen worked on the parigot core services and Bradley Smith
    worked on our devops problems.
