The lead shortcode creates a paragraph with the *lead* class to make it stand out. Great for introductions or summaries.

{{< lead >}}
I'm a lead paragraph. That means I'm more important. And you can see that.
{{< /lead >}}

## Usage
Simply place the following shortcode on the page
{{< code lang="html" >}}
{{</* lead */>}} [content] {{</* /lead */>}}
{{< /code >}}
